# Environmental-Caption-Generation-for-Visually-Disabled
This project aims to develop a web-based image captioning application that allows users to obtain object descriptions by simply uploading an image. With a single click, individuals with partial blindness can identify various objects around them.

Our application leverages machine learning to detect objects within images and generate relevant captions. Image captioning, the process of producing textual descriptions for images, is a significant and fundamental task in the field of deep learning, with numerous applications.

Through this project, we seek to create an accessible and user-friendly image captioning web app. By harnessing the power of machine learning, our application will generate accurate and helpful captions for uploaded images, thereby assisting individuals with low vision.
